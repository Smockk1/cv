CV website for Kodee Smock

As of 09/11/2019, here is the list of things I'd like to change/add:
        - Remove code redundancy
        - Implement new/custom javascript animation
        - Start a React.js project and either link CV site to it or implement it right into the site
        - Add website interactivity
        - Ensure website is fully responsive and "mobile first" friendly
