      I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University
      as a full-time student majoring in Media and Information
      and minoring in Computer Science. During my full-time
      class schedule, I also work part-time for the Department
      of Technology, Management, and Budget assisting the
      Treasury of Michigan. In my 2 years working with DTMB,
      I have been exposed to SAP systems and the ABAP programming
      language, as well as useful business programs and proper
      documentation techniques with the use of Microsoft Office
      and Visio. I also have intermediate to beginner level experience
      in working with various programming languages such as
      C++, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and React.js. Some of my
      knowledge on these languages is self-taught, and some
      was learned from the classroom. I am seeking jobs in
      front-end development and/or full-stack development.
