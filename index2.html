		  I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University
		  as a full-time student majoring in Media and Information
		  and minoring in Computer Science. During my full-time
		  class schedule, I also work part-time for the Department
		  of Technology, Management, and Budget assisting the
		  Treasury of Michigan. In my 2 years working with DTMB,
		  I have been exposed to SAP systems and the ABAP programming
		  language, as well as useful business programs and proper
		  documentation techniques with the use of Microsoft Office
		  and Visio. I also have intermediate to beginner level experience
		  in working with various programming languages such as
		  C++, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Some of my
		  knowledge on these languages is self-taught, and some
		  was learned from the classroom. I am seeking jobs in
		  front-end development and/or full-stack development.
